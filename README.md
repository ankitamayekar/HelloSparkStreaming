A typical supercomputer has thousands of sensors recording hardware data (among other things) such as voltages, temperatures, error codes, etcâ€¦  Abnormal temperature readings are particularly indicative of failure (or potential failure). We are going to process a raw stream of temperature sensor data to get experience working with both single event and windowed streaming processing.
